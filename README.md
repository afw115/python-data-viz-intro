Year 1 Data Analysis and Visualisation using Python

This series of IPython notebooks introduces students to visualization and data analysis using Python platform. 

The current course consists of 6 three hour sessions: 

*   3 Workshops where concepts are introduced and students are guided on how to complete tasks
*   2 Exercise sessions where problems are given and students are expected to complete tasks in a more autonomous fashion.
*   1 Open session covering spill over from the previous 5
