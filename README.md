An introduction to data visualisation and analysis using Python
-------

This is Imperial College's Year 1 Data Analysis and Visualisation using Python for first year chemistry undergraduates.

It is a series of IPython notebooks that introduce students to visualization and data analysis using Python as a platform. 

The first three workshops introduce concepts and students are guided through completing tasks. The final two exercise sessions involve problems where students are expected to complete tasks in a more autonomous fashion.
