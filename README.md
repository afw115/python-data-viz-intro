An introduction to data visualisation and analysis using Python
-------

This is Imperial College's Year 1 Data Analysis and Visualisation using Python for first year chemistry undergraduates.

It is a series of IPython notebooks that introduces students to visualization and data analysis using Python as a platform. 

The current course consists of 6 three hour session, consisting of 3 Workshops where concepts are introduced and students are guided on how to complete tasks, 2 Exercise sessions where problems are given and students are expected to complete tasks in a more autonomous fashion and a final open session covering spill over from the previous 5.
