An introduction to data visualisation and analysis using Python
-------

These IPython notebooks form the basis of a course on data analysis and visualization thought at the [Chemistry Department of Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry) as part of the first year undergraduate curriculum.
The purpose of the course is to introduce the basic data analysis techniques required to interpret experimental (or otherwise) data collected in the laboratory, along with exposing the IPython notebook as an electronic, multi-media and computation-able notebook the students are encouraged to use through their degree.

While deliberately avoiding exposing students to computer programming, this course could serve as a pre-introduction to the subject. The students are exposed to the notions of variables, data structures in the form of arrays, functions, and more generally to a computing platform and the Python language.

The course was design as a self learning interactive exercise using IPython notebooks.
The first three workshops introduce concepts and students are guided through completing tasks. The final two exercise sessions involve problems where students are expected to complete tasks in a more autonomous fashion.
